      <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently a senior working towards my Bachelorâ€™s of Arts in Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University with minors in animation and programming. My academic experience has provided me with the tools to become an effective designer. I am proficient with the Adobe creative suite and have begun expanding my skills in web design and video editing. With the additional experience I will gain completing projects and class assignments, I will be ready for the workforce by June 2017.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            With more than four years of experience working in team and customer service environments, I am well equipped to participate collaboratively in cross-functional teams as an intern. My strong work ethic, personal drive, attention to detail, and desire to continually learn and adapt to new environments will benefit the projects we can work on together.
